\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{Conclusion}

With the proliferation of cardiac deaths around the globe, a clinically adaptable continuous ECG monitoring technique is sought.
In this work, we propose a formal runtime monitor developed from the temporal policies of ECG for continuous monitoring of ECG. The RV-based monitoring of timed policies and the ECG processing module efficiently detect anomalies in cardiac activities by classifying ECG. Also the framework is explainable as the internals are known. The RV monitor's accuracy and low overhead illustrate the proposed approach's efficacy.

\textit{Future work}: The proposed analysis and monitoring framework can be tested using other datasets. We would like to extend this work to include morphological features of ECG for a more reliable framework. The feasibility of deploying it on wearable devices is yet to be studied
