%\subsubsection{Implementation}
We implemented a two module prototype to showcase our method. The \texttt{ECG\_Processing} module (Python + NeuroKit2~\cite{makowski2021neurokit2}) reads signals from the PTB-XL dataset, applies peak detection and wavelet analysis, and emits sequence of time stamped events: $R_{peak}$, $P_{onset}$, $P_{offset}$, $QRS_{onset}$, $QRS_{offset}$, $QRS_{onset}$ , and $T_{onset}$, $T_{offset}$. These events are fed into the \texttt{RV\_Monitor} module (Python 2.7 + UPPAAL DBM~\cite{UPPAAL}), which loads the product automaton and, for each event, emits either $c\_True$ or $c\_False$.


%From PTB-XL we gathered a dataset of 30 individuals, each contributing a single ECG recording. Every ECG spans 10 seconds and is sampled at a rate of 100 Hz. As a result, we obtained 3000 data points, where each data point is classified as either currently true or currently false. We evaluate our model using three standard metrics:

From the PTB-XL database~\cite{wagner2020ptb}, we gathered a dataset consisting of ECG recordings from 30 individuals, each contributing a single ECG recording. Each ECG recording spans 10 seconds and is sampled at a rate of 100 Hz. As a result, we obtained 3000 data points per recording, where each data point is classified as either currently true or currently false. We evaluate our model using three standard metrics:

\ignore{\begin{align}
	\text{Accuracy} &= \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \times 100\%, \\
	\text{Sensitivity} &= \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \times 100\%, \\
	\text{Specificity} &= \frac{TN}{TN + FP} \times 100\%,
\end{align}}

accuracy(\%) = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) $\times$ 100

aensitivity(\%) = [TP/(TP + FN)] $\times$ 100

apecificity(\%) = [TN/(TN + FP)] $\times$ 100


where
	$TP$ denotes true positives,
	$TN$ denotes true negatives,
	$FP$ denotes false positives,
	$FN$ denotes false negatives.


The RV framework achieved an accuracy of $98.3\%$, a sensitivity of $98.6\%$, and a specificity of $98.5\%$.


%\subsubsection{Discussion}
Most ECG classification works, as shown in Table \ref{Table:previous works}, focus on arrhythmia detection and classification. The proposed RV framework efficiently classifies ECG traces with arrhythmia, atrial enlargement, bundle branch block, conduction issues, \etc (cf.~\cite{}). It may be noted that typical ECG traces can deviate from the standard specifications, but with repeated violations of the policies, the user gets an early warning.
