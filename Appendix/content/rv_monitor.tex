%\begin{example}
	\begin{example}[Timed automaton]
		%Let us consider the property $P_3$ discussed in Section \ref{sec:pacemaker}. The TA in Figure \ref{fig:policy1} represents policy $P_{ECG1}$ (i.e; The PR interval in ECG should be in the range  120-200 ms.). In the TA in Figure \ref{fig:policy1}, the set of locations is $L=\{s_0, s_1, s_2 \}$, where $s_0$ is the initial location, and $\Sigma$ = $\{ \mathit{P_{onset}}$, $\mathit{P_{offset}}$, $\mathit{QRS_{onset}}$, $\mathit{R}$, $\mathit{QRS_{offset}}$, $\mathit{T_{end}}  \}$ is the set of events. The set of real-valued clocks is $X = \{x\}$. Transitions occur between locations depending on events.  On the transitions, there are guards with constraints on clock values such as $x > 200$,  and resets of clocks ($x:=0$). When the first event $\mathit{P_{Onset}}$ occurs, the TA moves to $s_1$ from $s_0$, and the clock $x$ is reset to 0. When in location  $s_1$, if the event $\mathit{Q}$ occurs and if $  120 \leq  x \leq 200 $, then the TA remains in location $s_1$, and resets the value of clock $x$ to 0, otherwise, it moves to location $s_2$. The location $s_2$  (non-accepting) should never be reached for the policy to be satisfied over runs.

	\red{	Consider the policy $\varphi_{ECG1}$ mentioned in Section \ref{sec:ecg}: "The PR interval in ECG should be in the range 120-200 ms". The TA representing the policy is shown in Figure \ref{fig:policy1} where the set of locations in the TA is $S=\{s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3 \}$, with $s_0$ is the initial location, and the set of events is $\Sigma$ = $\{ \mathit{P_{onset}}$, $\mathit{P_{offset}}$, $\mathit{QRS_{onset}}$, $\mathit{R}$, $\mathit{QRS_{offset}}$, $\mathit{T_{end}} \}$. Here, there is a single clock $x$ ($C = \{x\}$ is the set of real-valued clocks) to measure the elapsed time between events. Depending on the events, transitions take place between places satisfying guards. In the TA, the guard $x$ $\geq$ 200, and clock resets ($x:=0$), are present on transitions. The clock $x$ is set to zero and the TA is moved to $s_1$ when the first event $\mathit{P_{offset}}$ takes place. If the event $\mathit{QRS_{offset}}$ occurs while the TA is in location $s_1$ and if the guard on the clock $x$ ($ 120 \leq x \leq 200 $) is satisfied, it stays in location $s_1$ and resets the value of clock $x$ to 0, otherwise it moves to the location $s_2$. The location $s_2$ (non-accepting) should never be reached to satisfy the policy over the runs. When in $s_2$, a $\mathit{P_{offset}}$ event triggers a transition to $s_3$ and resets $x$; if $\mathit{P_{offset}}$ does not occur, the TA remains in $s_2$. Then, upon a $\mathit{P_{offset}}$ event in $s_3$, if 120 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 200 holds, the TA returns to $s_0$; otherwise it transitions to $s_2$.}
	\end{example}
	The trace/timed word ($\sigma$) processed by the TA is a sequence of events along with time, for example, $\sigma=(e_1,t_1)\cdot(e_2, t_2)\cdots(e_n, t_n)$, where $e_i$ is an event and $t_i$ is the time of occurrence of the event. {Given a finite alphabet $\Sigma$, the set of timed words over $\Sigma$ is denoted by $\tw(\Sigma)$.}

\subsection{Runtime verification (RV) monitor}
%\vspace{-0.25em}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{definition}
	\label{def:rv:mon}
	Let $\varphi$ be a policy specified as TA $\calA_\varphi$. The RV monitor is a function $M_{\varphi}: \tw(\Sigma) \rightarrow \D$, where $\D= \{c\_True, c\_False\}$. Formally,
	\ignore{Consider a monitoring policy $\varphi\subseteq\tw(\Sigma)$ is formalized as a timed automata  $\calA_\varphi$, then the verification monitor synthesized from $\calA_\varphi$ can be represented as a function $M_{\varphi}: \tw(\Sigma) \rightarrow \D$, where $\D= \{c\_True, c\_False\}$. The RV monitor is defined as follows considering $\sigma \in \tw(\Sigma)$ as the current observation: }
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\vspace{-0.5em}
	\[
	\begin{array}{lll}
		M_{\varphi}(\sigma) & =
		\begin{cases}
			c\_True & \mbox{if}\ \ \sigma\in\varphi \\%\wedge \exists \sigma'\in \tw(\Sigma): \sigma\cdot\sigma'\not\in\varphi \\
			c\_False & \mbox{if}\ \ \sigma\not\in\varphi %\wedge \exists \sigma'\in \tw(\Sigma): \sigma\cdot\sigma'\in\varphi \\
		\end{cases}
	\end{array}
	\]
\end{definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\vspace{-0.5em}
The monitor $M_{\varphi}$ for the policy $\varphi$ takes $\sigma$ as input and emits a verdict from the set $D = \{c\_True, c\_False\}$, where $c\_True$ stands for \emph{currently true} and $c\_False$ for \emph{currently false}. It reads $\sigma$ event by event, and after each event, it emits $c\_True$ if $\sigma$ satisfies $\varphi$, $c\_False$ otherwise.
%After reading the timed word $\sigma$, if the policy is satisfied with the current observation, the monitor emits the verdict $c\_True$, otherwise, $c\_False$.
%\vspace{0.5em}



	
\begin{example}	
	Let's consider the policy $\varphi_{ECG}$ = $\varphi_{ECG1}$ $\cap$ $\cdots$ $\cap$ $\varphi_{ECG5}$ to monitor with a sample ECG trace. Let $(P_{onset},270)\cdot(P_{offset},350)\cdot(QRS_{onset},360)\cdot(R,420) \cdot (QRS_{offset}, 470) \cdot (T_{end}, 890)$ be the sample ECG input event sequence with the occurrence time (in ms). The RV monitor receives the trace, and each event is associated with a delay that represents the amount of time since the preceding event or the system initialization. Table \ref{tab:BPMon} displays the monitor's step-by-step behaviour.
	
	The first event $P_{onset}$ is received by the ECG monitor at $t=270$, and the monitor emits $C\_True$ because the policy is not violated. The event $P_{offset}$ is observed at $t=350$, and the monitor emits $C\_True$. (as P-wave duration is within a safe range and the policy is satisfied). The monitor will once again output $C\_True$ for the event $(QRS_{onset},360)$ because the PR interval is less than 200 ms, and the policy is not violated. The monitor emits $C\_True$ for the following event $(R,420)$ because the policy is satisfied. The monitor once more emits $C\_True$ because the QRS-complex duration is within a safe range, and there is no policy violation when the event $QRS_{offset}$ occurs at $t=470$. The policy is false for the event $(T_{end}, 890)$ since the QTc interval should be between 350 and 480 ms. As a result, the monitor will output the verdict $C\_False$, indicating that the currently observed trace violates the policy.
